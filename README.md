# Autonomous-car
I have developed an autonomous vehicle using C++ which can:
1) Drive on the line (vertically and horizontally).
2) Differentiate between all colors on the track.
3) Drive on a line and count where you are (both vertically and horizontally). 
4) Drive on the line, turn 90 degrees and keep driving on the new line.
5) Drive on the line for two squares, turn 90 degrees and keep driving on the new line for two squares.
6) Drive from one point to another (keep track of where it is on the map). 
using color sensors, infrared sensors, and an ultrasonic sensor.
